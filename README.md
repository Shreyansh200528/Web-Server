# Node.js Static File Server with Logging and Graceful Shutdown

This server made in Node.js handles lightweight HTTP and serving static files. It delivers requested files from a directory named 'www' and displays custom error pages for statuses 403 and 404 from the error directory. Requests are all logged by the server and it executes a graceful exit when shutting down on a termination signal.

## Features

- üì¶ - Files are automatically sent from the `www/` folder
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom error pages:
    -403 Forbidden
    -404 Not Found
- üïí All requests to the server log timestamps, types of method used, IP addresses connected, the pathname asked for
- üõë  If you send `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`, the program will finish all its functions and shut down.
- üîí It disconnects from servers you are still using, before finishing the shutdown.
